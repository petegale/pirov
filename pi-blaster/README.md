pi-blaster
==========

This project enables PWM on the GPIO pins you request of a Raspberry Pi. The
technique used is extremely efficient: does not use the CPU and gives very
stable pulses.

Pi-blaster project is based on the excellent work of Richard Hirst for
[ServoBlaster](https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits).


## How to install

### Arch Linux

Thanks to [Patrick Wozniak](https://github.com/patlux), you can easily install pi-blaster
on archlinux with:

    yaourt -S pi-blaster-git

And activate the systemd-service with:

    sudo systemctl enable pi-blaster

### Build your own deb package and install with dpkg

The Debian package relies on systemd which means you must have Raspbian 8 or
later (aka "Jessie"). Run `cat /etc/debian_version`) to check what version
you are currently running.

Install the debian tools required to compile and prepare the package:

    sudo apt-get install debhelper dh-autoreconf dh-systemd dpkg-dev \
      init-system-helpers autoconf

And build the package:

    dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -i && sudo dpkg -i ../pi-blaster*.deb


### Build and install directly from source

The build environment is based on Autotools to allow for compilation on the
Raspberry Pi, or cross-compilation.

You may need to install `autoconf` to build. On Raspbian and other Debian based
systems this can be achieved with:

    sudo apt-get install autoconf

Building is extremely simple:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

To start pi-blaster and have it relaunched automatically on every reboot:

    sudo make install

Or to start pi-blaster manually run:

    sudo ./pi-blaster

And to uninstall, simply run:

    sudo make uninstall

This will stop pi-blaster and prevent it from starting automatically on the next
reboot.

## How to use

pi-blaster creates a special file (FIFO) in `/dev/pi-blaster`. Any application
on your Raspberry Pi can write to it (this means that only pi-blaster needs to
be root, your application can run as a normal user).

**Important: when using pi-blaster, the GPIO pins you send to it are configured
as output.**

To set the value of a PIN, you write a command to `/dev/pi-blaster` in the form
`<GPIOPinName>=<value>` where `<value>` must be a number between 0 and 1
(included).

You must use the GPIO number (BCM xx in the diagram below).

Examples:

  * To completely turn on GPIO pin 17:

    echo "17=1" > /dev/pi-blaster

  * To set GPIO pin 17 to a PWM of 20%

    echo "17=0.2" > /dev/pi-blaster

  * To turn off GPIO pin 17:

    echo "17=0" > /dev/pi-blaster

  * To release a pin so it can be used as digital GPIO or an input:

    echo "release 17" > /dev/pi-blaster

### NodeJS Library

NodeJS users can use [pi-blaster.js](https://github.com/sarfata/pi-blaster.js).

### C#

A C# example was contributed by [Vili
Volcini](https://plus.google.com/109312219443477679717/posts). It is available
on [this stackoverflow
thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17241071/writing-to-fifo-file-linux-monoc).

## How to adjust the frequency and the resolution of the PWM

On startup, pi-blaster gives you the frequency of the PWM, the number of steps
that you can control, the maximum and the minimum period of a pulse.

    sudo ./pi-blaster
    Using hardware:               PWM
    Number of channels:           8
    PWM frequency:                100 Hz
    PWM steps:                    1000
    Maximum period (100  %):      10000us
    Minimum period (0.100%):      10us

You can adjust those by changing a few defines at the top of the source code:

 * `NUM_SAMPLES`: The number of steps
 * `SAMPLE_US`: The time of one step (minimum period)

If you do not need a resolution of 1000 steps (approximately equivalent to a 10
bit DAC), then you can reduce the number of samples or increase the duration of
the steps.

Richard Hirst who wrote the original code recommended not going below 2us for
`SAMPLE_US`.

## Options

To override the default list of supported GPIO pins and specify fewer (or more)
you can specify a comma separated list of GPIO numbers. This is also the default
list:

    --gpio 4,17,18,27,21,22,23,24,25

To use the BCM2835's PCM peripheral instead of its PWM peripheral to time the
DMA transfers, pass the option:

    --pcm

This is useful if you are already using the chip's PWM peripheral, for example
for audio output.

To invert the pulse (off = pin HIGH, pulse = pin LOW), use:

    --invert

This can be useful for common anode LEDs or other devices that expect an
active-low signal.

To keep pi-blaster running in the foreground without running as a daemon use:

    -D

To view help or version information, use:

    --help

    --version

## Warnings and other caveats

**Pins being used by pi-blaster will be configured as outputs. Do not plug
something on an input or you might destroy it!**

This daemon uses the hardware PWM generator of the raspberry pi to get precise
timings. This might interfere with your sound card output.  There is
experimental support for a PCM time-source. If you are interested, I suggest you
look at Richard Hirst original project (ServoBlaster) and try the `--pcm`
option.

## A practical example: high-power RGB lighting

This library was developed for TBideas high power LED driver. You can read more
about this project on [our blog][blog].
